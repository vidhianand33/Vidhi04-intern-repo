Magic numbers, duplicate code, and deeply nested conditionals.

How Refactoring Helped:

- Improved readability and made the code easier to understand.
- Reduced redundancy and improved maintainability.

How Avoiding Code Smells Makes Debugging Easier:

- Clean code helps identify errors quickly and reduces confusion when fixing bugs.
- Makes collaboration with other developers smoother and more efficient.
