# Cyber Security Practices

What Security Measures Do You Currently Follow, and Where Can You Improve?

- I currently follow basic security practices like using strong passwords and enabling 2FA. However, I could improve by using a password manager for better organisation and ensuring my devices lock automatically when away.

2.How Can You Make Secure Behaviour a Habit Rather Than an Afterthought?

- Set daily reminders to review security practices.
- Enable automatic locking on my devices and regularly change my passwords.
- Be vigilant about phishing attempts by not clicking on suspicious links.
- Make 2FA a standard for all accounts and get used to it.

3.What Steps Will You Take to Ensure Your Passwords and Accounts Are Secure?

- Set up Bitwarden to manage all my passwords securely.
- Enable 2FA for all important accounts.
- Regularly change passwords and avoid reusing them across accounts.
- Use strong, unique passwords for every account.

4.What Would You Do if You Suspected a Security Breach or Suspicious Activity on Your Account?

- Immediately change my password and enable 2FA if not already enabled.
- Contact IT support or security personnel to investigate further.
- Review account activity for any unauthorised actions.
- Alert any relevant parties (e.g., clients, colleagues) if sensitive information was compromised.
