# React Debugging Strategies

1.Common Debugging Techniques

console.log(): Quickly checks values, states, and props in your components.
Code Walkthroughs: Read through code to spot mistakes or logic errors.
Breakpoints: Pause code execution to inspect values and step through your app.

2.Best Debugging Tools

React DevTools: Inspect the component tree and identify re-renders and performance issues.
Browser Console: Look for errors and warnings in your appâ€™s JavaScript.
VS Code Debugger: Use breakpoints and inspect variables in your code for deeper issues.

3.Debugging Large Codebases

Component Isolation: Test small components individually to spot issues.
Error Boundaries: Prevent the app from crashing by catching errors in specific areas.
Performance Profiling: Use React's Profiler to find performance bottlenecks.
Automated Testing: Catch issues early with unit and integration tests.
Logging/Monitoring: Use tools like Sentry for tracking errors in production.
