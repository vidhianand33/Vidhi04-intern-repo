# Agile principles

I have worked on a project before where we followed Agile principles. Since we had fixed deadlines and submissions, it made more sense for us to use Scrum. This helped us split tasks and submissions into different sprints with smaller, manageable tasks, making it easier to divide work among team members and track progress.
Moreover Agile is a flexible, iterative approach to project management that focuses on continuous improvement, collaboration, and adaptability. Unlike traditional project management  which follows a linear, step-by-step process, Agile allows teams to adjust and respond to changes quickly rather than sticking to a fixed plan.

Agile is built on four core values:

- Individuals & interactions over processes & tools – Teamwork and communication matter more than rigid workflows.
- Working software over comprehensive documentation – The focus is on delivering functional results rather than excessive paperwork.
- Customer collaboration over contract negotiation – Ongoing feedback ensures the final product meets user needs.
- Responding to change over following a plan – Agile embraces flexibility rather than rigidly sticking to an initial plan.

We used tools like Atlassian and Jira to manage our workflow. Our team had clearly defined roles, including:

Scrum Master – Facilitated meetings and removed roadblocks.
Product Owner – Managed the backlog and prioritized tasks.
Development Team – Focused on building and delivering the project.
This approach helped us stay organised, meet deadlines efficiently, and adapt to any changes during the project.

Summarising Scrum vs. Kanban

Scrum is structured with fixed sprints, defined roles (Scrum Master, Product Owner, Development Team), and regular meetings like stand-ups and sprint retrospectives. It's best for projects with set deadlines and clear deliverables.
Kanban is more flexible, focusing on continuous workflow with no fixed iterations. It uses a visual board to manage tasks, and progress is controlled by setting work-in-progress (WIP) limits. It works well for ongoing tasks like support or maintenance.

Most Useful Agile Principle in My Work

"Simplicity—the art of maximizing the amount of work not done—is essential."
This principle is useful because it helps prioritise tasks effectively, ensuring that only the most valuable work is done instead of overcomplicating things. It keeps the workflow clear, manageable, and efficient, avoiding unnecessary steps
