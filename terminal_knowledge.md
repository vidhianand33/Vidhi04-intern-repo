# Terminal Client

After researching different terminal clients, I chose iTerm2 with Zsh because it offers several powerful features, including:

* Split panes – Run multiple terminal sessions in one window
* Autocomplete – Speeds up typing by suggesting commands.
* Paste history – Helps recall previously copied text.
* Instant replay – Lets me scroll back through terminal output even after clearing it.
* Customisation – Supports themes, plugins, and prompt styling for a more efficient workflow.

Customisations made:

* Changed color schemes and appearance to improve readability.
* Installed Oh My Zsh, which enhances the shell with plugins and better defaults.
* Applied the Powerlevel10k theme to customise the prompt with icons, git status, and better visuals.

Useful commands learned:

* Command + / Command - – Quickly increases or decreases the text size in iTerm2, making it easier to read.
* Ctrl + R – Searches through command history, saving time when reusing commands.
