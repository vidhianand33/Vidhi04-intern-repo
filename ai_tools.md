AI Tools I Tried
I tried them all to be able to choose the best one for future

* GitHub Copilot (VS Code extension) – I installed GitHub Copilot in VS Code. It gives me code suggestions while I’m typing, which is really helpful when I’m stuck or need a quick fix.
* ChatGPT (for coding questions and debugging) – I’ve used ChatGPT to ask coding related questions and help me debug issues. It's mostly helpful and does give the easiest solutions and easy to understand explanations.
* Claude AI – I also gave Claude AI a try for code explanations. It’s another option like ChatGPT, but I found it less helpful when it came to answering development-specific questions.

What Worked Well?

* GitHub Copilot helped me a lot with code suggestions. It was especially useful for repetitive tasks or when I wasn’t sure how to organize my code. It saved me time and made coding smoother.
* ChatGPT was great for understanding new concepts and fixing small issues. For example, when I was learning Android Studio and Kotlin, it really helped me understand things quickly.

What Didn’t Work?

* Claude AI didn’t provide as detailed or accurate answers as I expected. It’s still useful, but I prefer ChatGPT for in-depth explanations and debugging.

When Is AI Most Useful for Coding?

* For me, AI is super useful when I’m trying to find small errors in my code. It’s easy to miss little mistakes, and AI helps me spot and fix them fast.
* AI is also great for learning new concepts. Sometimes, researching online is time-consuming, but if I need a simple explanation, AI is my go-to for easy-to-understand answers.
