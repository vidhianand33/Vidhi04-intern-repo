# Reflection

1.When do I prefer using AI vs. searching Google?

I use AI (like ChatGPT) for quick answers, code suggestions, or learning new concepts. It’s helpful for common issues or when I need a fast solution.

I turn to Google when I need more detailed research, want to read documentation, or need real-world examples from blogs or forums.

2.How do I decide when to ask a colleague instead?

I ask a colleague when the problem is complex, requires deeper knowledge of the project, or if it’s urgent. If the issue involves sensitive information, I also prefer asking someone I trust.

3.What challenges do developers face when troubleshooting alone?

When troubleshooting alone, it’s easy to get stuck or miss simple solutions. Without a second opinion, it can be hard to see blind spots or waste time on unimportant things. It’s also stressful handling complex or sensitive issues without help
