Reflection:
Shortcuts that I use the most are Command + X – Cut an entire line, Command + C – Copy an entire line , Command + Enter – Insert a new line below and Command + S – Save the current file as they save a lot of time but now that I have researched more I would try and save more time.

Using keyboard shortcuts means I don't need to keep reaching for the mouse, which makes things much faster. I can move around my code more easily and get things done without interruptions. This helps me focus and finish tasks faster.
