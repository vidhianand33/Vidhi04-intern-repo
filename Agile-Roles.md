Roles in an Agile Team

My Role: Software Developer Intern (React Native)

I have recently joined the team as a React Native Developer Intern, and based on my understanding, I will be working on the Focusbear mobile app.

My role will likely involve:
- Learning the Codebase: Understanding the existing structure, coding standards, and best practices.
- Developing Features: Assisting in implementing new functionalities under the guidance of developers like Toby Fazio.
- Fixing Bugs: Identifying and resolving issues in the app to improve user experience.
- Code Reviews & Collaboration: Working closely with team members to review code and integrate feedback.

Collaboration with Other Roles
- Weekly Standups: Project Manager intern  Megan Tian and CEO Jeremy to discuss my progress
- Frequent Collaboration: QA (Quality Assurance)
I assume I will frequently collaborate with Ngoc Ho Bao (QA) and Pedro Arteaga (QA intern) to ensure the app functions as expected.
- Collaborating with other developers under the guidance of senior developers. Through Github pull requests and code share

How We Can Improve Teamwork:
- Clear Communication: Providing detailed descriptions when working on tasks to ensure smooth testing.
- Testing Awareness: Learning about the QA process and writing efficient, testable code.
- Early Feedback: Engaging with QA early in the development process to identify potential issues sooner.

Since I am still onboarding and getting familiar with GitHub workflows, my responsibilities may evolve over time as I gain more experience.
