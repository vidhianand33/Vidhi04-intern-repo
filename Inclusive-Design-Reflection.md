# Inclusive Design Reflection

Understanding Vulnerable Populations

Vulnerable populations include people who may struggle with accessibility in digital spaces. This includes individuals with ADHD, Autism, dyslexia, or other cognitive challenges.

Challenges They Face in Digital Spaces:

- Confusing interfaces can be overwhelming.
- Bright colors and flashing elements can be overstimulating.
- Too many options can make decisions harder.
- Unclear instructions can cause frustration.
- Ethical Considerations in UX Design

To make our app more accessible, I’ll focus on:

- Keeping the interface clean and simple.
- Allowing users to customise settings (e.g., dark mode, reduced animations).
- Using clear and direct language.
- Avoiding overwhelming notifications.

Supporting Neurodivergent Team Members

To work well with neurodivergent teammates:

- Be clear and direct in communication.
- Respect different working styles and preferences.
- Minimise unnecessary noise or distractions in meetings.
- Be open to feedback and adjustments.

How I’ll Adjust My Communication

- Use short and clear messages.
- Provide written follow-ups after discussions.
- Give people time to process and respond.
- Ask how they prefer to communicate instead of assuming.

Possible Issues in Focus Bear

Some things that might make Focus Bear harder to use:

- Too many pop-ups and alerts.
- Confusing navigation or button placement.
- Bright colors that could be overstimulating.

One Change to Improve Accessibility

A simplified mode could help. This would remove distractions,offer muted colors for sensitive users and let users adjust text size and contrast.
