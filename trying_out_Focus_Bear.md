# User Experience

What was your first impression of the app?
My first impression of Focus Bear was that it’s easy to download and straightforward. I liked that it asks for all the necessary permissions upfront before accessing anything. It’s a thoughtful, user-friendly app designed to help people stay focused, combining routines with distraction-blocking features, which felt unique and effective, especially for people with ADHD. It’s simple yet effective.

Did you find anything difficult to understand?
I wasn’t quite sure how the focus alignment score works and how accurate it is. Also, I found the part where it asks to explain to the AI why I want to use a new site a bit confusing. It asks this repeatedly, and I’m not sure why as it wastes time. Plus, I’m wondering why does it only work on the sites I use online nd not on other programs like VS Code, which I use on the side.

If you had to explain Focus Bear to a friend in one sentence, what would you say?
Focus Bear is an app that helps you stay focused by blocking distractions, guiding you through personalised routines, and tracking your progress to keep you motivated throughout the day.

What are some changes that could improve the new user experience?
To improve the new user experience, it might help to have a brief tutorial or onboarding process that explains how to set up routines and use the focus modes. A step-by-step guide could make it easier for first-time users to understand the full range of features.
