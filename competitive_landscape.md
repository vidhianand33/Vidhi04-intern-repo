Competitive Landscape 

What makes Focus Bear different from these apps?
Focus Bear is different because it combines distraction blocking with helpful routines that guide you through your day. Most other apps either just block distractions or help you manage tasks, but Focus Bear does both. It helps you stay focused and structured by offering routines that support your focus and productivity throughout the day. I think it helps that focus bear is creatd taking ADHD people into special consideration so it has taken all measures to help a person focus.

If you were a user, why would you choose Focus Bear over competitors?
I’d choose Focus Bear because it gives me everything I need to stay focused. It doesn’t just block distractions; it helps me set up a routine that works for me, and tracks my progress to keep me motivated. It’s like having a personal productivity assistant that helps me stay on track without being too rigid.

What’s one feature that other apps have that Focus Bear doesn’t?
Other apps like Cold Turkey have a feature that completely blocks websites and apps, and you can’t get around it. Focus Bear is more flexible, so if you need a “hard block” where nothing can be accessed, Focus Bear doesn’t currently have that.

Based on your research, what’s one improvement you think Focus Bear could make?
I think Focus Bear could be even better by adding a hard block feature, like Cold Turkey, where you can completely block distractions and can’t bypass it. Also, the websites for other apps are a little cleaner and easier to read. It would be nice if Focus Bear could improve the look of its site to make it feel more user-friendly.
