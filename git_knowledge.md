Git Setup

I have used GitHub Desktop before this unit. I used it while working with Android Studio to keep track of my progress and ensure my code was safe. GitHub Desktop helped me manage my repositories and collaborate more efficiently.

I decided to stick with GitHub Desktop. I find it simplifies tasks and has a user-friendly interface, which makes Git operations easier to handle. However, I’ve also learned how to use Git in VS Code, as I understand it can be a more convenient option for those who prefer to work with only one application for both coding and version control.

The most interesting thing I learned is how GitHub offers different setups and tools based on the specific needs of the developer or user. It was also surprising to discover that Git in VS Code could handle all of the Git operations in one application, which is really convenient. However, for now, I’ll stick with GitHub Desktop, as it’s the method I’m most familiar with.
