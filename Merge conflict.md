Merge conflict 

What caused the conflict?
The conflict was caused by editing the same section of the file in two different branches. One change was made on the main branch, and a different change was made on the other branch. When trying to merge the branches, Git couldn’t figure out which change to keep, so it flagged a merge conflict.

How did you resolve it?
I opened the conflicting file in my Git client, where Git showed both changes marked with conflict markers. I reviewed both changes and decided which ones to keep. After editing the file to resolve the conflict, I committed the changes.

What did you learn?
I learned that merge conflicts happen when two branches make changes to the same part of a file. It’s important to manually review and choose which changes to keep during a conflict. I also learned how to use a Git client to visually resolve conflicts.
