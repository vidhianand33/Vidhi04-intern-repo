# Jest testing

Why is automated testing important in software development?
Automated testing is crucial in software development because it helps ensure that the code works as expected. It saves time by quickly catching bugs and errors whenever the code is updated, reducing the chances of issues going unnoticed. This helps maintain the quality of the software, speeds up the development process, and makes it easier to spot problems early on. Automated tests can be rerun every time the code changes, so the software remains reliable and stable, even as new features are added.

What did you find challenging when writing your first Jest test?
The hardest part of writing my first Jest test was understanding how to set everything up and making sure I had all the necessary imports. It was tricky figuring out how to select the right elements to test. The error messages were sometimes a bit confusing, but over time, I got more comfortable with the syntax and how Jest works. Used  npm test -- --verbose to get more details why the tests failed
It took a bit of practice to get my tests to run correctly, but once I got the hang of it, it felt rewarding to see them pass.
