# Occupational Health & Safety

Risk of using a laptop without external mointor or keyboard is:

- Fatigue
- Wrist injury or strain
- Bad Posture
- Eye strain

Equipment Changes:

- External keyboards and mouse
- Laptop stands or using a monistor instead
- Ergonomic chairs
- Standing desk or adjustable desk which has different settings

Behavioral Changes:

- Sit Upright: Keep your back straight and shoulders relaxed.
- Adjust Screen Height: Ensure the top of the screen is at or slightly below eye level.
- Take Regular Breaks: Stand, stretch, or walk around every 30â€“60 minutes.
- Use the 20-20-20 Rule: Every 20 minutes, look at something 20 feet away for 20 seconds to reduce eye strain.
- Maintain a Proper Arm Position: Keep elbows at a 90-degree angle while typing.

Posture & Break Reminders

- Use of Focus Bear or a Timer
- Phone Alarms for posture checks every hour.
- Sticky Notes on Desk

So at my home to internship work and to do my uni work I have starting using a external keyword. When I have to sit long hours like straight 4-5 hours I use my brother working space as he uses monitor, external keyboard and mouse, ergonomic chair and adjustable desk.
