# Agile Ceremonies  

Daily Stand-ups  

- Short (15 min) daily meeting for updates.  
- Focus on progress, plans, and blockers.  
- Enhances team alignment and quick problem-solving.  

Sprint Planning (Scrum)  

- Defines work for the sprint (fixed time period).
- Helps set clear goals and workload expectations.  

Continuous Prioritisation (Kanban)  

- No fixed sprints; backlog is updated dynamically.  
- Work is pulled based on priority and capacity.  
- Allows flexibility for changing needs.  

Retrospectives  

- Held at the end of a sprint or project phase.  
- Team discusses successes, challenges, and improvements.  
- Encourages continuous learning and adaptation.

Backlog Refinement  

- Ongoing process to review and update backlog items.
- Ensures clear requirements, estimates, and priorities.  
- Reduces sprint planning time and prevents delays.  

Team Collaboration in Agile  

Asynchronous Communication  

- Use Jira and Confluence for async stand-ups and updates.  
- Record meetings for team members in different time zones.  

Working Across Time Zones  

- Allow flexible work hours for some overlap.  
- Use shared documentation (Google Docs) for clarity.  

Task Management  

- Use Kanban boards (Trello, Jira) to track progress.  
- Regular backlog grooming to ensure priority tasks are ready.

Proposed Change: Introduce a weekly stand-up focus in advance so that team members come prepared, ensuring discussions are more structured and cover broader topics beyond just individual challenges.
